# Contributing guide

Welcome! We're excited that you're interested in contributing. 

Your contributions are highly valued, whether you're fixing bugs, improving documentation, or adding new features. We appreciate your efforts and support. For major changes, please start by opening an issue to discuss with the maintainers. Only minor bug fix PRs are typically accepted directly.

We are currently prioritizing and focusing on adding the providers feature, which is already a work in progress. Your help with this would be greatly appreciated.
